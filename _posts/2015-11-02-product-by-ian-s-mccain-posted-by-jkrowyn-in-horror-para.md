Product by Ian S. McCain Posted by: Jkrowyn in Horror, Paranormal, Reviews September 30, 2013 Comments Off 1,365 Views Ernie Chase is an alcoholic bum living on the streets of New York City. All he is worried about is finding his next drink and hiding from his daughter, Marie. Being a good daughter, Marie wanders the streets and volunteers at shelters continuously looking for her father. He used to be a good man and she just wants her father clean, warm and sober. Ernie's life has just about reached an all-time low. He breaks into a church and drinks the vicar's liquor. As he is laying in his box in some back alley, he winds up in the middle of what some gangsters think is a drug deal, but actually is much worse. Ernie ends up shot and blacks out. When he comes to, he is handcuffed to a cot in an abandoned hospital. Not only is he still alive, he now looks like a model in his early twenties. He feels no aches and his missing teeth are back in his mouth. A man named Gideon is by his bed telling him he has been infected with a virus, and the only treatment for it is receiving blood. Gideon teaches Ernie how to inject blood directly into his vein through a needle. He also finds out that he now has to work for Gideon for the rest of his life or die. There are more infected in the city, and Gideon provides the product for these infected. Ernie's new job is delivering this product to other infected and procuring humans for the farm where they make this product. To avoid notice usually only the homeless, gangsters or criminals are gathered. A year goes by with no trouble for Ernie, and then one evening he notices there are new infected in the city. They seem organized and Ernie grows curious. He wants more answers about himself and this virus. He grows sloppy during a routine gathering of new gangsters and things quickly get out of control. He knows he has to be careful because Gideon can still hold Marie's health over his head, but he will get his answers. Product is a dark, completely new take on the vampire. Ian McCain writes a superb story, giving us a complete history for his vampires, fleshing them out and making the reader care about what happens. They can have a conscious and care for others, and they can also be ruthless killers who do not give a damn. The fight scenes are vividly written and violent, and I could totally picture them happening. I did not see the ending coming and I want to rush out and read book two, Byproduct, right away.
