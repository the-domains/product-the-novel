description: 'Product [Ian S McCain] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers. Fifty-year-old Ernie Chase is just another liquor-soaked husk wandering the streets of New York City looking for his next drink; his body is broken and his mind is a slave to addiction. Things change when he is shot while witnessing a back alley drug deal.'
